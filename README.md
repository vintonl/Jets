## Jets Project

### Week 3 Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

This program is designed to process a comma-separated text file and user input data about Jets. The application can accommodate as many Jets as the user would like to enter via the text file or user input while in the application. Once the data is entered, the user can then select from a menu of options as to how that data can be processed and displayed.

### How to run:

First, the user enters their menu selection. The user can choose to:
1. List Fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View the fastest jet
4. View jet with the longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

The Jets Application will calculate and process the selection of your choosing.  

### Technologies used:

Java, Eclipse, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Java Libraries: Array List, Buffered Reader, File Reader, and handling exceptions with try/catch.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Object initiation, abstract objects, Primitive-Type Wrappers, and UML diagrams.

Java Fundamentals of Programming: Iteration, for loops, advanced for loops, while loops, and a switch statement.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming by allows me to use superclass references to subclass objects. I got to implement my new knowledge of using abstract classes and implementation classes to better use the multiple forms of objects.

I learned about and implements an ArrayList. ArrayList has an advantage over an array in that ArrayList can grow dynamically. This gave my application the ability to add subtract Objects as jets are added or subtracted.
