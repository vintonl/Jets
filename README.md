## Jets Project

### Week 3 Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

This program is designed to process a coma separated text file and user input data about Jets. The application can accommodate as many Jets as the user would like to enter via the text file or user input while in the application. Once the data is entered, the user can then select from a menu of options as to how that data can be processed and displayed.  

### How to run:

First, the user enters their menu selection. The user can choose to:
1. List Fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit
